==== NAME ====

Graphics::Colourset - create sets of colours.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.01'' of Graphics::Colourset.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This module generates the colour definitions of a set of colours suitable
for using as the basis of a colour-scheme for an X-Windows window-manager.
They can also be used for CSS colour descriptions for Web-pages. The colours
are defined as the usual "hex string", or as the more recent "rgb string".

The aim of this is to avoid having to generate harmonious colour schemes by
hand but to input a minimum number of parameters and to create all the
colours from that.


==== REQUIRES ====

    Graphics::ColorObject
    Getopt::Long
    Getopt::ArgvFile
    Pod::Usage
    Test::More


==== INSTALLATION ====

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a directory
under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

   perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

as the first step instead.

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules, and the PATH variable to find the script.

Therefore you will need to change: your path, to include
/home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

        PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
